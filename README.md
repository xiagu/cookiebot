This is a collection of scripts I originally wrote to automate different parts of Cookie Clicker, and eventually turned into an entire auto-playing script. 

Based on the information provided by [Cookie Monster](https://cookieclicker.wikia.com/wiki/Cookie_Monster_%28JavaScript_Add-on%29).

* Auto-buys the most cost-efficient buildings and upgrades. It takes into account the opportunity cost of saving up for the more expensive ones, too.
* Auto-clicks Golden Cookies (and Wrath Cookies too)
* Auto-buys the Elder Pledge, once it's available.
* Doesn't buy things if they would drop the bank below the minimum for lucky cookies, or frenzy lucky cookies if Get Lucky has been purchased
